# 💰 Expense Tracker

A simple and responsive web-based expense tracker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add expenses with a name and amount, view them in a list, delete individual items, and see a dynamically updated total. All data is saved in the browser using `localStorage`, so your expense history remains even after you refresh or close the page.
